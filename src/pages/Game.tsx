            a wealthier class ; and the relevAnts Whites (special Minted characters), which include

            All Ants are workers, and all take turns helping in every field: construction, food
            gathering, administrative or or support functions. Only soldiers are single-task, though
            all may become soldiers in times of need. There is no need for wages, as the colony
            provides everyone with basic means of sustenance, and no respectable Ant would have it
            any other way.
